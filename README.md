# Market-Basket-Analysis
ðŸ›’ðŸ“Š Market Basket Analysis with Apriori Algorithm

As part of my graduate capstone project, I conducted market basket analysis using the Apriori algorithm in Python to uncover associations between products. The original analysis was based on sales data from a local business.

I also built data visualizations in Power BI to communicate the results effectively. Based on the insights, I recommended focusing on specific product pairings to increase sales and suggested staff training to improve timely product availability.

This project strengthened my skills in Python, Power BI, and data-driven business recommendations, and gave me hands-on experience in applying analytics to real-world business problems.

Grateful to my teammates and professors for their collaboration and support!
